/*
compose provides a variety of apis to help us detect gestures that are generated
from user interactions. The APIs cover a wide range of use cases

some of thm are high level and designed to cover the most commonly used gestures.
for example the clickable modifier allows easy detection of a click and it also supports accessibility features
and displays visual indicators when tapped such aas ripples


There are also less commonly used gesture detectors that offer more flexibility
on a lower level like PointerInputScope.detectTapGestures or PointerInputScope.detectDragGestures but do not include the extra features
