/*
When building a custom component, review the implementation of a similar component in the Material library
or other Compose libraries. Then, mimic or modify its accessibility behavior as appropriate.

For example, if you replace the Material Checkbox with your own implementation, looking at the existing
Checkbox implementation will remind you to add the triStateToggleable modifier, which handles the
accessibility properties for the component.
*/

/*
Key points for custom components:

1. Review similar components in Material library for accessibility patterns
2. Use Foundation modifiers that include built-in accessibility considerations
3. Mimic or modify accessibility behavior as appropriate for your use case
4. Add proper semantic modifiers like triStateToggleable, clickable, toggleable
5. Ensure minimum touch target sizes (48dp)
6. Provide appropriate content descriptions for graphic elements
7. Merge semantics appropriately for compound components

See the "Clear and set semantics" section for an example of a custom toggle component.
