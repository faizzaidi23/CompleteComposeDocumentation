package com.example.FullComposeOfficialDocumentation.Accessibility_9.Support_user_scalable_content

/*
implementing the pinch to zoom gestures to support scalable content in the app
this is the standard platform consistent method for improving accessibility,
allowing the users to intuitively adjust the size of the text and the ui elements to fit their needs
the app can define custom scaling behavior with granular control and contextual behavior that offers an experience that users
often discover more quickly than a system level feature like screen magnification
